# Derivative-pricing and Interest-Rate-Modelling
## Overview

This repository contains a complete Python-based implementation of derivative pricing and interest rate modelling concepts taught in Class-10 of the course.
The project demonstrates the practical application of quantitative finance techniques using Python, with intuitive explanations, structured workflows, and replicable code.

## Key Objectives

- Implement core derivative pricing models from scratch in Python.

- Explore and apply interest rate modelling frameworks.

- Strengthen understanding of numerical techniques used in quant finance.

- Translate financial mathematics into efficient and interpretable code.
