# Derivative-pricing and Interest-Rate-Modelling
## Overview

This repository contains a complete Python-based implementation of derivative pricing and interest rate modelling concepts taught in Class-10 of the course.
The project demonstrates the practical application of quantitative finance techniques using Python, with intuitive explanations, structured workflows, and replicable code.

## Key Objectives

- Implement core derivative pricing models from scratch in Python.

- Explore and apply interest rate modelling frameworks.

- Strengthen understanding of numerical techniques used in quant finance.

- Translate financial mathematics into efficient and interpretable code.

## Topics Covered
1. **Derivative Pricing**

Conceptual explanation of derivative structures.

Pricing using risk-neutral valuation techniques.

Implementation of:

✔ Binomial Option Pricing Model

✔ Black-Scholes Formula

✔ Stochastic Volatility models


2. **Interest Rate Modelling**

Introduction to term structure of interest rates.

Discount factors, zero-coupon curves, forward rates.

Implementation of popular frameworks:

✔ Vasicek Model

✔ Cox–Ingersoll–Ross (CIR) Model

✔ Hull White Model


3. **Numerical & Simulation Techniques**

✔ Monte Carlo path generation

✔ Convergence checks and error analysis

4. **Tech Stack**

- Python 3.x

- NumPy for vectorized numerical computations

- Pandas for data handling

- Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization

- SciPy (where necessary for statistics and optimization)
